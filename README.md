# UEFA-EURO-2024
## Project Description

This project analyzes the UEFA European Championship 2024. It consists of two stages: the first stage is pre-Euro, and the second stage occurs after the championship has finished. In the first stage, we aim to identify information about the participating players and the countries involved. In the second stage, we will delve into the statistical analysis and uncover hidden insights. This involves examining player performance metrics, team dynamics, and any patterns or trends that emerge from the championship data. By doing so, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the tournamentâ€™s dynamics beyond the surface-level results
